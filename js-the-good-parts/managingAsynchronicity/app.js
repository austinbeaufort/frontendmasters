// MUTUAL EXCLUSION
// Only one thread can be executing on a critical section at a time.
// All other threads wanting to execute the critical section are blocked.
// If threads don't interact, then the program runs at full speed.
// If they do interact, then races will occur unless mutual exclusion is employed.

// ASYNCHRONOUS FUNCTIONS
// Return immediately. Success or failure will be determined,
// somehow in the future.

// TURN

// A callback function associated with the event is called,
// and will run to completion.
